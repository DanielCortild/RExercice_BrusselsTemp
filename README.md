# Instructions

- Import the data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielCortild/RExercice_BrusselsTemp/master/BrusselsTemp.csv

- Transform the Day, Month and Year fields into a more readable numeric format, and add a Date field.

- Transform the Temperature field into a celsius degree numeric field.

- Filter the data to retrieve only the measurements from 2019.

- Plot the Temperatures.

- Observe some data points are either extreme or missing (NA). Replace those by the mean of the "correct" data points in the same month.

- Create a function taking in a parameter Year. This function should plot the Temperatures from that given Year.
